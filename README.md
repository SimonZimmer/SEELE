# Introduction
A DAW-plugin inspired by the ficticious villian group SEELE from the animated series "Neon Genesis Evangelion" directed by Hideaki Anno.
In the series the members of the SEELE group can be seen in multiple conference calls discussing the *Human Instrumentality Project", where each member is represented as a talking monolith.
Inspired by this scene, this plugin is focussed on vocal processing using multiple pitch-morphing instances.

# Usage
Audio-processing consists of 7 SEELE members joined into one conference call.
Each of the SEELE members can be summoned using the toggle button underneath each monolith.
When activated, the input audio stream will be copied and summed to the main-output with it's loudness compensated.

Each member's *SANCTITY* parameter can be controlled by clicking and dragging the corresponding member monolith up and down.
The higher the *SANCTITY* of a SEELE member, the higher the perceived pitch of it's voice.
